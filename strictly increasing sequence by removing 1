'''Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence 
by removing no more than one element from the array. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example
For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be solution(sequence) = false.
There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be solution(sequence) = true.
You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].'''


def solution(sequence):
    n = len(sequence)
    flag = False
    for i in range(n-1):
        # not strictly increase
        if sequence[i] >= sequence[i+1]:
            if flag: 
                return False # flag means removed before
            flag = True
        if i == 0 or sequence[i - 1] < sequence[i + 1]:
            continue
        if i + 2 < n and sequence[i] >= sequence[i + 2]:
            return False
    return True
