"""Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

Example 2:
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 
Constraints:
0 <= low <= high <= 10^9"""
