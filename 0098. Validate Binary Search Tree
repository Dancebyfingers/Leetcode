'''Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
A valid BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.'''

# it would be re-initialized to its default value every time the function is called recursively.
# By making it a member variable of the class, its value persists between calls to the inorder function
