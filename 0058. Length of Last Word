'''Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.


Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.'''

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        # backward
        n = len(s) - 1
        cur , res = n, 0

        # edge case must =0 when testcase such as "e"
        while cur >= 0: 
            # iterate last word
            if s[cur] != ' ':
                res += 1
            # first space before the last word
            elif res > 0: 
                return res
            cur -= 1    
        return res
